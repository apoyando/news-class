For simplicity, I chose 3s; it's possible that imputing a user's average movie rating to unrated movies would have worked better. But whatever number we imputed for unrated movie, we would still be forced by the model type to \"learn\" from fake data. Collaborative methods don't have this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our NMF model also lacks user and movie bias terms, such as a user's tendency to rate movies higher or lower, and a movie's tendency to receive higher or lower ratings. Collaborative filtering can capture these biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, my choice of latent features, while informed by the data, is arbitrary and led to a very, very long run time. Given that the performance was only slightly better than the baseline methods, this approach might not be worth it.\n"

    "\n",
    "It's possible that performance could be sped up by minimizing the number of latent features to what's aboslutely necessary. But I would have to run and test the model many, many times to get the best number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The imputed ratings could be changed to the user average, the movie average, or some mathematical formula based on those. This would inherently correct for some bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "There might also be a gradient descent method I could use to correct for user and movie bias. This would involve iterating many times of the data set.\n",
